                DIBZ is a service that allows next-generation gamers to swap used games on-line, on a pay-per-swap basis, in a manner that offers more value for money than part-exchange or purchasing new games. Our vision is to enable as many people to play as many games as possible. Our service is trustworthy because we test the games before they are issued to swappers and we provide a reliability rating so members can decide who they swap with.
